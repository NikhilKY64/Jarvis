I'd be happy to help you with calculating subject percentages based on the data you have. However, I would need you to provide me with the data in order to do so.

Here is an example of how the data might be organized in an Excel spreadsheet:

| Subject | Mark | Total Maximum Marks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Math | 85 | 100 |
| English | 90 | 100 |
| Science | 75 | 100 |

With this data, you can use the formula =(B2/C2)\*100 to calculate the percentage for each subject, and then use the average function to calculate the overall grade.

=AVERAGE(D2:Dx)

Where D2:Dx is the range of cells containing the subject percentages.

Please let me know if you have the data and if you need help with the calculations.
