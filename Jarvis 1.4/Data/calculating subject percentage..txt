Hello Nikhil Kumar Yadav,

I am a content writer, and I would be happy to help you with your request to write content related to calculating subject percentages. Here is an example of a letter you might write to a teacher or professor requesting information on how subject percentages are calculated:

Subject: Request for Information on Subject Percentage Calculation

Dear [Teacher's Name],

I am writing to inquire about how subject percentages are calculated for the [course name] that I am currently taking. I am working on a project that requires me to understand how my overall grade is determined, and I would appreciate it if you could provide me with some information on this topic.

Specifically, I am interested in understanding how the percentage for each subject is determined and how it factors into my final grade. I would also like to know if there are any weightings or adjustments made to the percentages for different subjects.

I would be grateful for any information or resources you could provide on this topic. Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

Additionally, here is an example of a simple formula that can be used to calculate subject percentage:

Subject Percentage = (Subject Mark / Total Maximum Marks) \* 100

This formula can be used to calculate the percentage for each subject, and then those percentages can be used to calculate the overall grade for the course.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
